# Brian 2 simulation of memory consolidation in recurrent spiking neural networks based on synaptic tagging and capture

This package serves to simulate recurrent spiking neural networks, consisting of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons connected via current-based plastic synapses, with the [Brian 2 simulator]().
The long-term plasticity model that is employed features a calcium-based early phase and a late phase that is based on synaptic tagging-and-capture mechanisms. 
The underlying model has been described in detail in [Luboeinski and Tetzlaff (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-01778-y) and has previously been implemented with a [stand-alone simulator](https://github.com/jlubo/memory-consolidation-stc) and with the [Arbor simulator](https://github.com/jlubo/arbor_network_consolidation). The code provided here can serve to reproduce the previous results. However, note that a fast-forward approximation for running the network on long biological timescales (minutes to hours), which is available in the other implementations, has not been implemented here yet.
